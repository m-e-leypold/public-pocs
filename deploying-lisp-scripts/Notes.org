* Automatic generation of entry-points scripts

Note, that the entry point scripts are rather stereo-typical. The do
not do much, actually.

So, sbcl-script might provide make based (?) infrastructure that
creates those scripts from nothing (or rather, just a definition of
the entry points).

* Creating projects from templates

Most of the project is actually in the *.asd and the
Makefile. sbcl-script (or another dedicated) package could provide a
way to initialize a project by expanding a template.

This would create the Makefile (with project integration) and the
*.asd (following the other conventions, like load-all, etc).
